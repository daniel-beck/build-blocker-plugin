# Build Blocker Plugin

## Introduction

Quieting down Jenkins prevents builds from starting, but they still get queued for execution later.

This plugin allows blocking the scheduling of all new builds.

## Getting started

To block scheduling of builds, check _Block scheduling of new builds_ in the section _Build Blocker_ of _Configure System_.
